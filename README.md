# SmartCommute2
Smart Commute for Petoskey Area, 2.0. .Net MVC Entity Framework

This is version 2.0 of Smart Commute Emmet. This web application allows users to create accounts, or login with Facebook, and then track
their smart commutes. They can compare their progress with other commuters on the leaderboards, and view their own and other people's 
overview on their profile pages. This includes total commutes, distance traveled, latest commutes, a profile picture, their employer,
when they registered, and other information. There are also resources for rewards and sponsor offers, among other features.

Version 1.0 was created in PHP with no framework or prior web development (or programming) knowledge to speak of. This is a much needed update
to the original project and utilizes SOLID programming principles, .Net Core MVC, Entity Framework, and other technologies.

This is is a work in progress.
